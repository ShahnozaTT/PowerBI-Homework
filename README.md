13. What are "gateways" in Power BI, and when are they needed?
•	A gateway connects on-premises data sources (SQL Server, Excel files, ERP systems) to Power BI Service.
•	Needed when reports in the Service require live or scheduled refresh from on-prem databases.

•	Row-Level Security (RLS) – restricts what data users can see.
•	Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication.
•	Data encryption at rest and in transit.
•	Auditing and compliance certifications (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
