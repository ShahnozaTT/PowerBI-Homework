## Lesson 9  
**Topic:** Understanding Context in DAX & CALCULATE and Basic Filters, Variables  
**Prerequisites:** Download DAX_Context_Practice.xlsx file.  

1. What is row context? Give an example in a calculated column.  
2. Write a measure that finds total sales  
3. Use RELATED to fetch the Name from the Customers table into the Sales table.  
4. What does CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]), Sales[Category] = "Electronics") return?  
5. Explain the difference between VAR and RETURN in DAX.  
6. Create a calculated column in Sales called TotalPrice using row context (Quantity * UnitPrice).  
7. Write a measure Electronics Sales using CALCULATE to sum sales only for the "Electronics" category.  
8. Use ALL(Sales[Category]) in a measure to show total sales ignoring category filters.  
9. Fix this error: A calculated column in Sales uses RELATED(Customers[Region]) but returns blanks.  
10. Why does CALCULATE override existing filters?  
11. Write a measure that returns average unitprice of products  
12. Use VAR to store a temporary table of high-quantity sales (Quantity > 2), then count rows.  
13. Write a measure ```% of Category Sales``` that shows each sale's contribution to its category total.  
14. Simulate a "remove filters" button using ALL in a measure.  
15. Troubleshoot: A CALCULATE measure ignores a slicer. Whatâ€™s the likely cause?
